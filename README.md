Calculate smelted materials by shipper code

# Problem definition
This project is to automatically calculate smelted quantities disaggregated by shipper code, to reduce labor and risk of errors.

When concentrate inventories are low, the smelter requires daily tracking of smelted concentrates segregated by shipper codes. However, smelt data is only available on mixed input streams.
Disaggregating smelted quantities by shipper code is time consuming and error-prone. The current process is manual data entry and Excel calculations is slow, port composition estimates introduce smelt quantity errors.
